The Redmi Note 15 Pro+ 5G pushes the boundaries of what a “midrange” phone can do by combining flagship-style features with strong all-around performance. At its core is a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 4 chipset paired with up to 24 GB of RAM, delivering smooth multitasking, gaming, and everyday responsiveness. The phone’s 6.83-inch CrystalRes AMOLED display impresses with a rich 1.5K resolution, vibrant colors, a 120 Hz refresh rate, and extremely high peak brightness perfect for outdoor use and media consumption.
Photography is a major highlight, thanks to its 200 MP triple-camera system with advanced imaging modes and optical stabilization (OIS), enabling detailed shots across different lighting conditions. A large 32 MP selfie camera handles clear front-facing photos and video calls with ease.
