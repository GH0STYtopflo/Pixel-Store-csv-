The camera setup includes a 50 MP main sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS), a 12 MP ultrawide, and a 5 MP macro lens, enabling versatile shooting across different scenarios, while a 12 MP front camera handles selfies and video calls with clarity. A 5,000 mAh battery keeps the phone going through long days, and 45W fast charging helps you refill quickly. The device also offers an IP67 water and dust resistance rating, an under-display fingerprint sensor, stereo speakers, and modern connectivity like NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, and 5G support.
Running Android 15 with Samsung’s One UI 7, the A56 promises up to six years of Android upgrades and security updates, bringing long-term software support typical of more expensive phones.
